* Minimizes to tray

Usage
-----

* **Timeout** specifies how often to check if the mouse needs moving. Must be between 0.1 seconds and 1 hour (3600 seconds)
* **Move Range** specifies the maximum distance the mouse should move. Must be between 0 px and 1000 px
* **Anchor** anchors the mouse to only move around the starting position
