Mouse Mover
===========
Stop your computer from auto locking

* Moves your mouse a little if no mouse movement has been detected after a specified amount of time
* Doesn't hinder using the computer normally but still won't let the computer lock out

Usage
-----

* Timeout specifies how often to see if the mouse needs moving. Must be between 100 ms and 1 hour
* Move Range specifies the maximum distance the mouse should move. Must be between 10 px and 1000 px
* The default values of 60 seconds and 100 pixels should be appropriate for most use cases
* If manually setting the timeout, set it to **under half** your computer's lockout time
* If the mouse moves too often for you to stop, press space if the stop button has focus (Focus appears as a little square around the button text). If it doesn't, alt-tab until the mouse mover window has focus then press tab till the stop button has the inner focus
